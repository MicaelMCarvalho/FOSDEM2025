### Program to Learn: The Power of Creative Coding

- **Speakers:** Bernat Romagosa, John Maloney, Jens Mönig, Jadga Huegle
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 10:00 - 10:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5369-program-to-learn-the-power-of-creative-coding/)

#### Abstract

What was your first programming language? For some, it might have been Logo; for others, Scratch. Regardless of the language, many of us have fond memories of creating playful, creative programs as kids - not because we had to, but because it was fun.
What many don’t realize is that the joy of these early experiences wasn’t by chance. It stems from the pioneering work of Seymour Papert, Cynthia Solomon, and others at the MIT Logo Lab in the late 1960s. They developed an educational philosophy called constructionism - the belief that children learn best when engaged in creative projects that connect with their personal interests. This philosophy shaped not only Logo but an entire lineage of educational programming tools designed to make coding fun, expressive, and meaningful.
Today, as the "Learn to Code" movement is challenged by generative AI, researchers and educators are revisiting these roots. They view programming not merely as a utilitarian skill for the job market but as a medium for exploration and creative expression. From analyzing complex data to creating art and understanding systems, programming can be much more than a language to be learned - it can be a language for learning.
For education, free and open-source software is a cornerstone. Free software ensures that tools remain accessible to all, fosters collaboration, and empowers learners to not only use but also understand and modify the systems they engage with - crucial for digital sovereignty.
In this talk, we’ll take you on a whirlwind tour of some of the most influential programming languages designed for children, from Logo, Smalltalk, and Etoys to Scratch and their modern descendants like Snap! and MicroBlocks. Rather than just describing these languages, we’ll show you their power through live demos.

### Rust for Linux

- **Speakers:** Miguel Ojeda
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 13:00 - 13:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6507-rust-for-linux/)

#### Abstract

Rust for Linux is the project adding support for the Rust language to the Linux kernel.
This talk will give a high-level overview of the project and will walk its history from the beginning -- it sounds like it was yesterday when we started, but it has been more than 4 years now.
How did the endeavor start? What challenges have we faced? Who are the people behind it? Which projects do we collaborate with? How are we reconfiguring a large system with huge inertia while it keeps running? Can a similar approach be applied to other projects? What do kernel developers think about Rust?
Speaking about Rust, why did we go with Rust, and not something else? How stable is the Rust we use in the kernel? What does it mean to use unstable features in this context? How did we hedge against those? What is the situation with distribution toolchain support? What about GCC and Rust?
And most importantly, since this is open source: how can someone contribute?

### 14 Years of systemd

- **Speakers:** Lennart Poettering
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 16:00 - 16:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6648-14-years-of-systemd/)

#### Abstract

Almost a decade and a half ago we introduced systemd, and it since has been adopted by most commercial and community distributions in one form or another.
Let's have a look back at the tumultuous beginnings, how we became what we are now, and let's talk a bit the perspective for the future, what systemd is supposed to be in the eyes of its developers – and what it shouldn't be.

### The Big FOSDEM Quiz of the Year

- **Speakers:** Steven Goodwin
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 18:00 - 18:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4388-the-big-fosdem-quiz-of-the-year/)

#### Abstract

How much do you know about Free Software, Open Source, Developers, and European meetings?
We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to bring you a lively TV-style quiz show featuring  several rounds of questions deemed too geeky for TV - about kernels, software projects, and digital culture. (Some will offer mass audience participation!)
As a fun game it will separate the Red Hat's from the Red Star's, the Linus Torvalds from "some random person in Nebraska", and is a fantastic way to enjoy our community even more.

- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5495-what-floss-means-in-the-ai-world/)

#### Abstract

In an era where artificial intelligence is simultaneously celebrated and scrutinized, how can we ensure that technological innovation serves humanity's best interests? Mitchell Baker, Chair of the Mozilla Foundation and a former Mozilla CEO, will share how Mozilla is pioneering ethical AI development, drawing parallels to our historic contributions to open source by releasing Netscape’s source code in 1998 and inventing the Mozilla Public License in 2012.
From democratizing speech technology through Common Voice and establishing rigorous ethical AI guide, to developing innovative open-source AI projects like Llamafile, Mozilla has been doing extensive work in the AI ecosystem by defining a principled approach to AI that prioritizes transparency, ethics, and community-driven innovation. Learn how we're applying the same open-source philosophy that revolutionized software development to the complex challenges of artificial intelligence, and how Mozilla has been playing a key role in defining a definition of Open Souce AI.

### Early Screening of "ZeMarmot" animation film (work-in-progress) with live music

- **Speakers:** Jehan, Aryeom, ORL AMMD
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 11:00 - 11:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6370-early-screening-of-zemarmot-animation-film-work-in-progress-with-live-music/)

#### Abstract

« ZeMarmot » is a short animation film project by members of the GIMP team, drawn in GIMP and animated in GIMP and Blender. The film itself will be released under Libre licenses (CC by-sa, Art Libre), including the music and all source files for both graphics and music.
Aryeom is the film director and basically did everything graphics-wise, from storyboarding to drawing, coloring, backgrounds, animating and editing.
Jehan is the scenarist and technical side of the project, patching GIMP, Blender and other software. He became GIMP’s maintainer while working on ZeMarmot as direct consequence of this movie project.
The production is LILA, non-profit film production based in France working with Free Software and producing Libre Art movies.
Music is composed and recorded by AMMD, a cooperative of artists producing Libre Art music with Free Software (such as Ardour).
The short is a bit less than 10 min and is still work-in-progress, i.e. it is in unfinished state (some coloring and backgrounds are missing in particular). Instead of recorded music, musicians from the AMMD will be present and play live on the video. The screening will be followed by presentation and questions.

### The Growing Body of Proprietary Infrastructure for FOSS Development: Repeating Bad History

- **Speakers:** Bradley M. Kuhn
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 15:00 - 15:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6153-the-growing-body-of-proprietary-infrastructure-for-foss-development-repeating-bad-history/)

#### Abstract

Over the last fifteen years, we have drifted from a nearly fully FOSS suite of community tools to primarily proprietary ones.  Most developers lament the outcome, but the classic "convenience factor" of proprietary software has returned with a vengeance.  Rarely is this issue discussed, and virtually no one is planning next steps for transition away from the proprietary development infrastructure technologies.
Indeed, the culmination of our shared, learned history in this community is the tools we use to develop our software should, themselves, also be Open Source and Free Software.  We survived the proprietarization & ad-banner-infestation of Sourceforge.  We escaped the proprietary licensing regime of BitKeeper & wrote replacements (Git & Mercurial). Many lessons were learned.
Today, however, FOSS projects rely more than ever on partly or wholly proprietary tools, such as GitHub, Slack, Jira, Groups.io & the like. Even worse, GitHub has become a "hub" for sale of third-party proprietary bots, yielding even more reliance on proprietary technology by FOSS developers.
This talk is for anyone who works as a developer, community manager, organizer or collaborator in a FOSS project.  Nearly every FOSS project today includes a piece of proprietary infrastructure, and often contributors don't even realize what parts of their infrastructure are proprietary.
Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.  This talk is a step in the direction of remembering the past to prevent that repetition which currently seems inevitable.
This talk surveys how bad the situation has become, what we can learn from our prior community interactions with proprietary systems and discusses how we can organize to begin solving this problem yet again.

### How we are defending Software Freedom against Apple at the EU's highest court

- **Speakers:** Lucas Lasota
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 16:00 - 16:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5084-how-we-are-defending-software-freedom-against-apple-at-the-eu-s-highest-court/)

#### Abstract

Apple is one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world. Its unbalanced power spans over software and devices, trapping end-users and developers in tight lock-ins. This approach has prevented Free Software to flourish in environments controlled by Apple.
The EU has reacted to Apple's monopolistic practices by passing the Digital Markets Act - a law containing several anti-monopoly obligations against big tech. By designating Apple as a "gatekeeper" of digital markets in the EU, the DMA, the company has now to comply with several rules regarding sideloading, enabling of alternative app stores and interoperability of its operating systems.  Apple has put forward an aggressive policy against the DMA. The company started litigation against the Euopean Commission to dodge DMA obligations.  
Due to the high risks against software freedom, the FSFE was granted right to intervene in the case. By demonstrating that Apple is being regulated in light of public interest, the FSFE is proving to the court that interoperability and software freedom are compatible with human rights. 
This talk will explain why this court case is pivotal for Free Software in Europe. In case the FSFE succeeds, Free Software developers will enjoy higher degrees of software freedom in Apple devices. They will also enjoy better access and interoperability by being able to demand effective and free-of-charge interoperability between their software and Apple’s software and hardware.

### Ten Years as a Free, Open, and Automated Certificate Authority

- **Speakers:** Josh Aas
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 17:00 - 17:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5130-ten-years-as-a-free-open-and-automated-certificate-authority/)

#### Abstract

People deserve a secure and privacy-respecting Internet. Ubiquitous HTTPS is an essential part of delivering on that vision. To that end, our public benefit certificate authority has been issuing TLS certificates free of cost in a reliable, automated, and trustworthy manner for ten years. We went from issuing our first certificate in 2015 to servicing over 500,000,000 websites in 2025, and we’ve got big plans for the future.
TLS is a core Internet technology, relevant to almost all developers. We’ll talk about how we try to make the working lives of developers around the world easier, while learning lessons from the developer community about how to do our job better.
We’ll aim to provide interesting history and helpful context for those managing TLS certificates today, as well as some heads up and guidance for the future. We’ll also talk about changes coming down the pipe, including better resiliency via ACME Renewal Information (ARI), the end of the OCSP revocation information protocol, shorter lived certificates, and support for IP address certificates.

## Main Track - Janson (7)

### Rewriting the future of the Linux essential packages in Rust ?

- **Speakers:** Sylvestre Ledru
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 14:00 - 14:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6196-rewriting-the-future-of-the-linux-essential-packages-in-rust-/)

#### Abstract

The Linux ecosystem depends on core utilities written decades ago in C, but modern needs demand safer, more maintainable tools. Over the past four years, the Uutils (Coreutils, findutils, diff,) project has reimagined these utilities in Rust, offering secure, performant replacements. To the point that it is now shipped by default in some Linux distributions and used in production.
In this talk, we’ll explore a bold vision for the future of Linux: one where Rust becomes the backbone of its essential tools, ensuring long-term security, maintainability, and performance for generations to come.

### The Selfish Contributor Revisited

- **Speakers:** James Bottomley
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 15:00 - 15:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6540-the-selfish-contributor-revisited/)

#### Abstract

In a previous FOSDEM I described the selfish contributor:
https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/selfish_contributor/
Which is the archetypal scratching your own itch contribution.  The
original talk mostly focussed on how to deal with corporations, which
tend to act rationally and are usually persuadable.  In this talk I'd
like to look at individuals and their motivations and how their
selfish motivations can be harnessed efficiently.
By now everyone has heard the phrase "toxic individualism" which
simply means putting your rights and needs over that of the community.
Many Codes of Conduct try to characterize this behaviour and that, in
turn, can lead to a general fear because many actions of a selfish
contributor could be classified as toxic behaviour because under this
definition, every non-altruistic action (even scratching your own
itch) could fit the definition.  One would think therefore that
successful and vibrant communities must be tolerant of some form toxic
behaviour to avoid driving away potential contributions, but that
isn't true either.  What actually happens is that successful
communities evolve strategies for harnessing what would otherwise
become toxic behaviours to serve the community.
This talk will explore how conditions arise in a community for
harnessing selfish impulses to the good of the community.  Sometimes
it can be community processes, but most often it is people who spot
the issue and help mediate a solution which benefits both the
contributor and the community at large.  This talk will also explore
what those skills are and how to develop them and also touch on how,
even in the best communities, those mechanisms can fail and give some
hints for recognizing when this has happened and what to do about it.

### Forked Communities: Project Re-licensing and Community Impact

- **Speakers:** Dawn M Foster, Brian Proffitt, Stephen  Walli, Ben Ford
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 17:00 - 17:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5258-forked-communities-project-re-licensing-and-community-impact/)

#### Abstract

Many popular free and open source projects are owned and driven by corporations, and in today's difficult economic climate, those companies are under increasing pressure to protect their businesses or show stronger returns for investors. One response to this pressure has been the relicensing of popular open source projects to more restrictive licenses like what we’ve seen with MongoDB, Elasticsearch, HashiCorp’s Terraform / Vault, and Redis to name just a few. These companies are putting their projects under non-open source licenses, despite there not being consistent evidence that this actually generates improved financial outcomes for those companies.
In some cases, this relicensing has resulted in a hard fork of the original project. Both the relicensing and the resulting fork create turmoil for the users of that project and the community of contributors. In this panel, we’ll discuss the following topics: dynamics around relicensing that results in such hard forks; examples of forks along with the impact on the communities; and thoughts about what this means for the future of free and open source software. The audience will gain an appreciation of why relicensing results in hostile forks and how to think about this issue when selecting projects for contribution or usage.

### The Road to Mainstream Matrix

- **Speakers:** Matthew Hodgson
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 12:00 - 12:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6274-the-road-to-mainstream-matrix/)

#### Abstract

We are living in incredibly exciting times for open source social and communication apps - with the likes of Signal, Mastodon and bluesky showing that open source alternatives can go viral with a mainstream audience, and genuinely challenge and indeed displace the traditional proprietary centralised options.
While Matrix has good uptake with open source communities, chat powerusers and public sector deployments, Matrix has still been laying the groundwork for mainstream uptake.  In this talk, we'll explore where Matrix uptake has worked so far, and why, and what we're doing to ensure Matrix will fulfil its promise as the open communication layer of the web for everybody.
We'll cover:


Current Matrix traction in the Public Sector & FOSS communities


The remaining feature delta with typical mainstream chat apps


The challenges of private contact discovery, key verification, and anti-abuse tooling


Matrix's relationship to other decentralised communication initiatives


The plan for closing the remaining gaps to get Matrix in the hands of the masses!


Matrix (matrix.org) is an open protocol for secure decentralised communication, hopefully familiar as the primary chat system used for online FOSDEM since 2021.

### Was Leslie Lamport Right?

- **Speakers:** Sarah Christoff
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 13:00 - 13:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4941-was-leslie-lamport-right-/)

#### Abstract

Leslie Lamport, the Father of Distributed Systems, has produced extensive research, many of which date back to the 1970s. These theories are often quoted as "impractical" in modern distributed systems, but how many millions of dollars could we have saved by implementing them if they weren't?
We will learn the history of distributed systems and the man whose thinking started a movement. We take dense concepts such as concurrency, consistency, and clocks and teach through fun, real-world, practical experiments reminiscent of high school science class. 
Leaving science and going to music class, we will strap together a cluster of nodes with a gossip protocol to showcase how the protocol establishes membership and sends messages with sound.
Once school is out, it's time to bring it back to the real world, showcasing how Lamport influenced cloud native systems. Empowering you to deliver research-driven change within your organizations and minimizing 3 AM pages while adding content to make resumés shine.
Finally, you will be able to answer: Was Leslie Lamport Right?

### Lessons learned Open Sourcing the UK's Covid Tracing App

- **Speakers:** Terence Eden
- **Room:** Janson
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 14:00 - 14:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4411-lessons-learned-open-sourcing-the-uk-s-covid-tracing-app/)

#### Abstract

On the 7th of May 2020, six-weeks after lockdown was announced, the source code for the UK's COVID-19 contact tracing app was published on GitHub.  I was the person who pushed the button which set it free.
This is the story of how Open Source helped save lives.
Come and learn about how we convinced the NHS to open source the app. What pitfalls there were. How we allayed security concerns. What went wrong. How we dealt with trolls. Which other countries around the world used open source. And why it was so important to be as transparent as possible.
This talk asks if we did the right thing? Did we pick the right licence? Should have done something differently? Could we have been more open? Were the risks justified? Was being Open Source a help or hindrance?
This is a personal recollection of a very strange period in health-tech history.

## Main Track - K Building (17)

### Code Is Different: How the Norms and Nuances of the FOSS Developer Community Drive Content Moderation on Code Collaboration Platforms

- **Speakers:** Margaret Tucker
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 10:00 - 10:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6120-code-is-different-how-the-norms-and-nuances-of-the-foss-developer-community-drive-content-moderation-on-code-collaboration-platforms/)

#### Abstract

Software code is not just content—it’s the foundation of critical digital infrastructure, and its unique functional purpose demands a specialized approach to platform governance. Unlike other digital media, code is widely duplicated, remixed, and shared under open source licensing terms, presenting distinct considerations for copyright and moderation. Additionally, the dual-use nature of software, such as security research projects, introduces complex challenges: tools designed to identify vulnerabilities can also be exploited for malicious purposes. Moderating a code collaboration platform requires careful consideration of open source software’s function as critical digital infrastructure and the network effects of takedowns. Likewise, code collaboration platforms must reflect the free and open source developer community’s values of collaboration and transparency, while empowering maintainers to support the health of their projects. 
In this presentation, authors of the recently published article “Nuances and Challenges of Moderating a Code Collaboration Platform” in the Journal of Online Trust and Safety will discuss key takeaways. We’ll provide an under the hood look at how GitHub has developed tools and policies tailored to the needs of the free and open source software developer community. This will include a diverse set of case studies, including how we’ve responded to legal and policy challenges such as the EU Copyright Directive and US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, how we’ve evolved our approach to dual-use software over time, and how notable incidents such as the youtube-dl takedown and reinstatement have influenced our developer-first approach to content moderation. We will also touch on the importance of community content moderation and the tools we have developed for maintainers to establish expectations for conduct and contribution on their projects. Attendees will leave with an understanding of how the values of the free and open source developer community inform the governance of code collaboration platforms and how they can engage with platforms and policymakers.

### Incremental Memory Safety in an Established Software Stack: Lessons Learned from Swift

- **Speakers:** Doug Gregor
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 12:00 - 12:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6176-incremental-memory-safety-in-an-established-software-stack-lessons-learned-from-swift/)

#### Abstract

In recent years, it has been repeatedly shown that memory safety problems account for the vast majority of security vulnerabilities in software systems. In response, security researchers and government agencies alike have urged software developers to replace their use of C and C++ with memory-safe programming languages. Fortunately, there are several native programming languages to choose from, but there is a catch: you must rewrite your code to get these memory-safety benefits. In today's established software systems, that could mean rewriting hundreds of millions of lines of existing C and C++ code, which is beyond impractical.
To move memory safety forward in an established software system, we propose an incremental approach comprised of three parts. First, use of a memory-safe language (in our case, Swift) for new code or for targeted rewrites. Second, memory-safety improvements to C and C++ that can be applied to large swathes of existing code. Finally, deep interoperability between the memory-safe language and existing C and C++ without sacrificing memory safety. This talk will explore all three aspects of this approach in the context of Swift, and will reflect on lessons learned for both programming language design and rollout in an established software system.

### A memory allocator with only 0,006% fixed overhead written from scratch

- **Speakers:** Nils Goroll (slink)
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 13:00 - 13:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4479-a-memory-allocator-with-only-0-006-fixed-overhead-written-from-scratch/)

#### Abstract

How can you efficiently allocate tiny (kilo to megabyte sized) objects on petabytes of storage? Write a memory allocator from scratch which uses less than two bits per 4KB.
This talk focusses on an interesting aspect of the SLASH/ storage engines for Varnish-Cache which uses a simple yet super efficient buddy memory allocator, a very well known algorithm from the 1960s.
The primary novelty of this implementation is that it uses a fixed amount of metadata at about two bits per minimum page size. It also supports prioritized fair waiting allocations and an interactive live view.

#### Abstract

SBOMs are in the limelight now as the silver bullet for many things - open source license compliance, vulnerability management, copyright management and the path towards a healthy, secure and CRA-certified happy state of a binary life. But behind all this marketing and makeup is a fairly simple syntax and a lot of missing pieces in the puzzle. Let’s dive into the SBOM lifestyle together and look at the current status, the hopes and the vision for a toolset with less hype, but more real benefits for compliance, developers, product managers, with a chance of being a workhorse in risk management as well as the automatic vulnerability management toolchain. Help us make the SBOM dream come true, listen to the talk and then walk the SBOM walk!

### Zephyr: Open Source Project Best Practices Over Time

- **Speakers:** Kate Stewart
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 16:00 - 16:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6311-zephyr-open-source-project-best-practices-over-time/)

#### Abstract

In 2024, the Zephyr project hit a milestone by becoming one of the few open source projects with over 100,000 commits in it's main repo.   Why are developers joining and contributing to it? 
When the project launched in 2016, there was the commitment from the start apply known best practices to its development.  While Zephyr is a different code base, a lot of the lessons learned from the Linux Kernel Community were applied to forming it's community.  The project focused on incorporating security best practices as the were identified right from the start,  and is now working towards formal safety certification.
This talk will go through some of the best practices that have been applied for developing open source projects, and illustrate the results of applying these best practices.

### Next Generation Internet 2025: where next?

- **Speakers:** Michiel Leenaars
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 09:00 - 09:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6508-next-generation-internet-2025-where-next-/)

#### Abstract

In 2018 the study "Next Generation Internet 2025" was presented at FOSDEM to MEP Marietje Schaake by a team from NLnet Foundation and Gartner Europe. At that point in time, the Next Generation Internet initiative was just about to get started. The report laid out a practical vision for what such an initiative could aim to become - based on input from a consultation by the authors across the European tech and digital rights community.
At the time Europe had made some inroads on tech regulation, but was nowhere in terms of untangling its own technical debt. The hope was for NGI to put at least some public funding to work to make technology more human centric and develop concrete FOSS alternatives. Just a few years before, the vast threats to our privacy and security had been painfully highlighted by the revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The unspoken ambition for NGI was to start reducing Europe's dangerous dependency on big tech companies running dark code in foreign jurisdictions. The report defined a number of strategic objectives and considerations, centered around user empowerment - and with an underlying ambition to improve our digital sovereignty and create the technology stack we want.
So, now it is 2025. So where do we stand? In this talk, Michiel Leenaars, project lead and co-author of the original "Next Generation Internet 2025" study, will look back on how the Next Generation Internet initiative worked out so far - and where it can and should go next. With hundreds of thousands of developer hours funded across all layers of technology through programmes like NGI Zero, the Next Generation Internet has pushed technological sovereignty more than any other EC supported effort. Check. Hundreds of projects ranging from free and open source videoconferencing, open social media, libre chip technology, productivity tools, post-quantum cryptography, tools to improve the software supply chain, podcasting and many more have been spawned - making it one of the largest FOSS programmes ever to exist. Check. An impressive amount of pretty hex stickers now adorns the laptops of many European software developers and their kids, making them the nicest looking hackers on the planet. Check. The Next Generation Internet it seems has delivered, but so far is not included in the European Commissions plan's for future programmes. Erm?
Our problematic technological entanglement isn't solved yet, in fact: the situation is arguably more dire than ever. The geopolitical climate calls for technological disentanglement and a strategic move to free and open source software and digital commons, but what concrete steps are taken in Europe at the decision level? An embarrasing low came from the European Commission itself, as it is now suing its own data protection supervisor, after it was concluded that the current use of Microsoft Office 365 isn't according to European legislation - and so the EC should not be using that expensive, insecure and non-confidential cloud service. If you have to sue your own guardian angel because you cannot do without a digital typewriter and an app doing calculations on tabular data hosted on another continent, you are probably fairly desperate. So what should our new European Commissioner Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy be working on for the next five years of the 'digital decade'? Starting from the vantage point of the Next Generation Internet initiative in 2025, where do we go?

### APuP: A Hundred-Line Hack to Make Wi-Fi Great Again

- **Speakers:** Gioacchino Mazzurco | G10h4ck
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 10:00 - 10:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5195-apup-a-hundred-line-hack-to-make-wi-fi-great-again/)

#### Abstract

In many scenarios, such as community networks, the need to maximize the possible
communication paths between nodes arises. In a classical AP-STA approach, it is
not possible to guarantee communication between all nodes in every scenario,
even by resorting to very complex configurations.
To overcome this issue, ad-hoc mode was used in the past, which solved the basic
connectivity problem. However, its implementation was not of high quality, and
its design had significant flaws, which eventually led to it becoming
unmaintained after a few years.
Luckily, as ad-hoc mode became outdated, 802.11s emerged with some improvements.
However, certain design choices—such as the complex methods for bridging other
networks and routing between nodes—were fossilized into the standard, increasing
Wi-Fi driver complexity. This ultimately led to its silent demise.
New radio drivers and firmware do not support 802.11s well.
New Wi-Fi standards do not bring many improvements to 802.11s mesh mode,
although they significantly improve AP-STA modes. Nonetheless, the need for
nodes to communicate with anyone in range remains strong
In this context, while searching for a modern solution,
I began asking myself: is there a hard-to-resolve problem that prevents AP nodes
in sight from communicating directly with each other?
After discussing my ideas with Felix Fietkau (nbd), we agreed that it might be
possible for AP nodes to communicate directly with each other. Since AP mode
receives the most support and improvements, we realized that with slight
modifications, we could enable all APs in range to communicate with one another.
This could solve a problem that has plagued Wi-Fi since its inception.
With a bit of luck and a lot of persistence, I demonstrated that seamless AP-AP
communication is possible by modifying the hostapd code, without requiring any
kernel or driver changes.
Within a few months, this interesting experiment evolved into a new mode named
APuP, now included by default in both OpenWrt and DD-WRT. It opens a new rabbit
hole that could make Wi-Fi development and usage exciting again, potentially
rendering Ad-Hoc, WDS, 802.11s, Multi-AP, Wi-Fi Direct, and EasyMesh obsolete.
Let’s embark on a journey through this code, and then we’ll have even more fun
digging together 🕳️🐇⏰.

The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is preparing a statement of criteria for free machine learning applications. 
In this presentation the FSF will present the major considerations for defining what user freedom means in the rapidly developing field of machine learning, why it is different from defining software freedom, and why it matters. 

We will talk about why we use the term Machine Learning over Artificial Intelligence 
We will take a moment to discuss user freedom, what it means and why it matters
We will discuss how machine learning applications differ from software when considering user freedom
We will review what kinds of machine learning applications we should take into account when considering the broader issue
We will take the question of what (outside of software) elements of the application need to be considered and explain the FSF's position on it (think training data, model parameters, weights)
We will talk about how a machine learning application could have ethical reasons to remain nonfree, and how the FSF's criteria deal with this

### Anecdotes from 25 years of FOSDEM

- **Speakers:** FOSDEM Staff
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 14:00 - 14:30
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6729-anecdotes-from-25-years-of-fosdem/)

#### Abstract

Running a conference is chaotic at best. Running a large conference is even more intense. Running the largest Open Source conference on Earth with no entry fees, no way to plan attendees, with only volunteers is extreme.
Join us for a few anecdotes of how we made the magic happen, and how sometimes it was very close to having major impact on the conference, without the attendees ever even noticing anything amiss.

### Nostr, notes and other stuff transmitted by relays

- **Speakers:** Wouter Constant
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 15:00 - 15:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6452-nostr-notes-and-other-stuff-transmitted-by-relays/)

#### Abstract

Nostr is an open protocol for censorship resistant publication and social networking.
At the end of 2022 the former CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey confessed his love to this protocol. Also Edward Snowden started to use Nostr. Why? What makes Nostr that special? Why should you care?
This presentation will identify the core problems of the current landscape, how Nostr works and addresses these problems, and lastly arguments for why Nostr has a shot at succeeding in bringing in a new paradigm where other attempts have failed thus far. It will go into technical detail and should leave the audience with the proper start and motivation to join this free and open source movement rebuilding the web and guaranteeing freedom of association on the internet. 
Nostr has no official website, but currently details and discussions about the protocol can be found in the Github NIPs repository: https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips. 
Some other trustworthy Nostr resources are:

### Converting an '07 car to an RC EV using open source software

- **Speakers:** Marc Lainez
- **Room:** K.1.105 (La Fontaine)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 16:00 - 16:50
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4971-converting-an-07-car-to-an-rc-ev-using-open-source-software/)

#### Abstract

In december 2023, Loïc, Thibault and Marc embarked on a journey to convert a 2007 VW Polo into an EV using only off the shelve components such as Raspberry pis and Arduinos. Today, the car is drivable, and can even be controlled remotely. The entire software they wrote for it is open source and built using Elixir, a language running on the Erlang Virtual Machine (the BEAM). Their platform uses CAN communication to serve as a gateway and translate messages from the different components they used for their project (A nissan Leaf motor, a Tesla brake booster, and more...). In this talk, they will drive you through the process they went through to get to a fully working car and give some insights on how they made everything work together.

## Lightning Talks (38)

### Automated testing for mobile images using GNOME

- **Speakers:** Sam Thursfield
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 10:30 - 10:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5649-automated-testing-for-mobile-images-using-gnome/)

#### Abstract

The GNOME project has some end-to-end tests running with openQA and os-autoinst. So far these test GNOME OS integration, the Shell and core applications, accessibility features and more. However, all these tests assume a desktop form factor.
To help GNOME work well on mobile, we also have a gnome_mobile test suite, but there are currently some missing features in QEMU and os-autoinst which limits how useful these tests are.
This lightning talk will cover:

Why mobile devices are different from desktops and laptops, and why the current gnome_mobile tests are not good enough
How QEMU can better support mobile form factors
What we might need in os-autoinst to start simulating multi-touch inputs to a mobile device.

### NethServer 8: Solid Foundation for Self-Hosting Web Applications

- **Speakers:** Gabriel Cossette
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 13:10 - 13:25
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6467-nethserver-8-solid-foundation-for-self-hosting-web-applications/)

#### Abstract

Self-hosting Web applications is a practice that is useful both in the personal and business context. Depending on the situation, we can enjoy better privacy, flexibility, performance and reduced costs. However, some "boring" aspects we need to think about are backups, authentication, security, scalability and management across servers.
In this lightning talk, I will present a new multi-server container-based solution that sets a solid foundation for self-hosting, while remaining simple to use and operate: NethServer 8.

### Increasing security of internet downloads with Asfaload

- **Speakers:** Raphaël Bauduin
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 13:50 - 14:05
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5886-increasing-security-of-internet-downloads-with-asfaload/)

#### Abstract

Asfaload aims to secure internet downloads by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of downloaded files.
With attacks on the software supply chain becoming more common and more sophisticated, an effective and simple to use solution has to be found for both the developers and their users.
All our published software is under the AGPLv3 or MPLv2, and allows for a self-hosted deployment.
The first building block of our solution is a mirror of checksums files, which helps detect modification of released files but is of no help in case of account compromise. That's why we are also working on an upcoming multi-user multi-factor signature scheme. Initially it was blockchain-based, but we transitioned to a git repo, making it even more auditable.
For end users, we develop a CLI downloader tool with its accompanying library at asfald.
As for software developers, publishing a checksum file (with sha256sum or sha512sum) is sufficient to integrate with Asfaload.
In this talk we will present the problem we are addressing, why it is important, how we are addressing it and what simple steps project authors can take to increase the security of their users.

### Treating build definitions independent of their origin

- **Speakers:** Klaus Aehlig
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 14:10 - 14:25
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4337-treating-build-definitions-independent-of-their-origin/)

#### Abstract

Most software build systems, following the tradition of make, refer to artifacts by an assigned location on the file system. However, when developing software, one is usually more interested in the contents of the file than its location. So why not take the definition itself as key? Similarly, when building typical complex targets, like libraries, additional information has to be considered when using them, e.g., transitive dependencies when linking. So why not make that part of the data of the analyzed library? In this way, we obtain definitions that are independent of their origin and hence can meaningfully be cached. This high-level caching allows a seamless transition between fine-granular building and traditional package building (obtaining all artifacts by a single lookup). As an additional benefit, when using remote build execution, it is enough to have the sources of the project you're working on, while still having the benefits of a bootstrapped build.
All those concepts are implemented in the open-source build system justbuild, available, at https://github.com/just-buildsystem/justbuild

### sshproxy: how to load-balance ssh

- **Speakers:** Cyril Servant
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 14:30 - 14:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4788-sshproxy-how-to-load-balance-ssh/)

#### Abstract

ssh (secure shell) is a popular protocol used for remote command-line connections and file transfers.
sshproxy is more than a simple ssh proxy/load balancer. It can choose the destination node based on simple or complex rules, such as the user name/group, its previous connections, the number of total connections on the nodes, the total used bandwidth of the nodes… It can be distributed on multiple gateways, with shared states. It can track, log and monitor all the connections.
At CEA (French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission), sshproxy allows users to connect to 4 different supercomputers, with regularly more than 1,000 simultaneous connections.

### LoRaMesher library for LoRa mesh networks

- **Speakers:** Felix Freitag, Joan Miquel Solé
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 14:50 - 15:05
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4476-loramesher-library-for-lora-mesh-networks/)

#### Abstract

We present LoRaMesher, a communication library to build LoRa mesh networks. LoRaMesher interconnects geographically spread IoT devices through a LoRa mesh network. For the communication, the library implements a proactive distance vector routing protocol. Using LoRaMesher, an IoT application running on a node can send and receive data packets to and from other nodes in the LoRa mesh network. LoRaMesher has been tested on embedded boards featuring an ESP32 microcontroller and a LoRa radio. Using LoRaMesher, nodes do not connect to a LoRaWAN gateway, but among themselves. This allows new, distributed applications solely built upon tiny IoT nodes.

- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 15:10 - 15:25
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4290-all-the-world-s-a-stage-running-a-theatre-show-on-open-source-software/)

#### Abstract

You can run anything on open source software, even a big conference. But have you ever tried running a theatre show with free and open software? Turns out you can. For the last five years, I have been running the technical side of a local theatre company with only free and open source software. Come to my talk to hear how we did it, what software we use(d) (and why), and what kind of bumps we hit.
We use open source software for the entire process, from preparation (writing the script, holding meetings), to ticket sales, our website, seat planning, audio mixing and broadcasting, video broadcasting and programming the lights. No closed source software is used in the process. An added challenge is that neither the theatre group, nor the public, are a technical audience or are aware what open source software is.
If you ever want to assist your local theatre group (do, they really can use technical people who don’t want to be on stage), come and listen!

### Celebrating Open Standards: How Podcasting 2.0 Shaped the Future of Podcasting

- **Speakers:** Benjamin Bellamy
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 15:50 - 16:05
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5630-celebrating-open-standards-how-podcasting-2-0-shaped-the-future-of-podcasting/)

#### Abstract

Two years ago at FOSDEM, I gave a talk titled “How Podcasting 2.0 Will Save the Open Internet”.
I’ll be honest—it was partly a bluff.
But it turns out I was right.
Today, we are here to celebrate the victory of open standards in podcasting.
Podcasting 2.0, launched in 2020 to revitalize a stagnant ecosystem, introduced innovations like transcripts, funding tags, and social interaction features. These weren’t just tools; they empowered creators, listeners, and developers while keeping podcasting open and decentralized.
In a surprising turn, even Apple—long resistant to adopting anything "not invented here"—embraced the Podcasting 2.0 DTD specification in April 2024, bringing transcription features to its platform.
This was a milestone for open standards and open source. Transcriptions improve accessibility for millions, while also boosting SEO, content discoverability, and personalized recommendations. Through Castopod—one of the first platforms to implement Podcasting 2.0 features.
A grassroots, open-source movement is reshaping an entire industry.
But this victory is just the beginning.
Together, let us explore how the lessons of Podcasting 2.0 can be applied to other areas, ensuring that technology remains open, accessible, and collaborative.

### Kites for Future - Airborne Wind Energy for everyone

- **Speakers:** Marc de Laporte, Benjamin Kutschan
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 10:10 - 10:25
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5560-kites-for-future-airborne-wind-energy-for-everyone/)

#### Abstract

We are Benjamin and Marc from Germany, and our mission is to help solve the climate crisis by developing affordable, highly profitable, and resource-efficient (100 times less material compared to a wind turbine) airborne wind energy systems that can be deployed everywhere, quickly. We believe that an open source strategy can achieve this. Our first system, scaled for maximum affordability, will make powerful renewable energy available to everyone, even in winter and at night. Our prototype is already capable of everything that is needed for fully autonomous operation. See it in operation at kitesforfuture.de and on our Youtube channel!
Now, we need to make it fit for everyday use. For that, we would like to call on like-minded enthusiasts and supporters to join our endeavour. Until now, we have developed everything ourselves - from the aircraft and the ground station to the PCBs, and most importantly, the autopilot and control software, including web control and OTA-Update functionalities. In doing so, we have found clever solutions to produce the most simple yet safe system so far, building on Open-Source platforms such as the VESC motor controller wherever possible. Ever since our first steps in 2020, our progress could be followed on Github and Hackaday.
Our vision is to develop a powerful global community that together overcomes the problems that so far have plagued closed-source projects in airborne wind energy.
There is a lot of exciting stuff left to do: From testing and improving the control software to developing the first anti-collision system for Airborne Wind Energy based on transponder data and optical image detection...

### Finding Anomalies in the Debian Packaging System to Detect Supply Chain Attacks

- **Speakers:** Tobias Specht
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 10:30 - 10:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5224-finding-anomalies-in-the-debian-packaging-system-to-detect-supply-chain-attacks/)

#### Abstract

In this talk, the XZ Upstream Supply Chain Attack (CVE-2024-3094) is used as a case study to demonstrate how supply chain attacks can be detected by tracing the build system by a graph based approach. The increasing prevalence of supply chain attacks on Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects has been highlighted recently by the supply chain attack on the xz project to backdoor SSH servers. The detection of this particular attack was coincidental, raising concerns about potentially undetected threats.
C/C++ build systems, such as GNU autotools, Make, and CMake, have grown highly complex and diverse, exposing a large attack surface to exploit. However, essentially, these build systems all compile the source code to object files and link them together to executables or libraries. For FLOSS projects, we can be even more stringent by postulating that every binary must originate from source code within the upstream project. Technically, this relationship can be modeled by the help of a graph data structure. By traversing this graph, it can be ensured that all distributed binaries originate from upstream source code showcasing the successful detection of the supply chain attack.
Further studies could scale this approach to analyze all Debian packages regularly to detect anomalies early. To prevent attacks (or at least make them harder to conceal), the authors further propose transitioning to a descriptive build system, which reduces complexity and increases transparency, making separate tracing unnecessary.

### Imposing memory security in C

- **Speakers:** Maria Matejka
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)

- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6606-imposing-memory-security-in-c/)

#### Abstract

They say that Rust is going to replace C. I don't believe that and I wanna share how we're doing memory-safe operations in BIRD's C code with no need to enforce this by the language paradigm. It's obviously possible to override that, yet with the right policies and processes in place, it is almost impossible.

### Godot VR as a front end for ParaView (lightning talk)

- **Speakers:** Julian Todd
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 11:50 - 12:05
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4948-godot-vr-as-a-front-end-for-paraview-lightning-talk-/)

#### Abstract

Kitware's ParaView is the industry standard for interacting and visualizing the output from a Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation.  Unfortunately its VR/XR functionality is underdeveloped and underused in spite of the potential value this interface could bring to the analysis of these intricate spatial 3D structures.  We can change this by approaching the problem from the other direction starting with an open source VR/XR platform such as Godot Engine (which is high performance enough to run on stand-alone headsets) and import the ParaView geometry (meshes, streamlines, scalar fields) into it from across the network.  This way we can make use of the state-of-the-art VR tech that is being developed by the Godot community until it evolves into a desirable package.

### Disrupting the destruction of our natural world with openness

- **Speakers:** Tobias Augspurger
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 12:10 - 12:25
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5972-disrupting-the-destruction-of-our-natural-world-with-openness/)

#### Abstract

Despite the transformative power of free and open-source software (FOSS) across various sectors, its impact on one of the most urgent challenges of our time - environmental preservation - remains largely invisible. In response, the Open Sustainable Technology community has developed a range of strategies to make FOSS an essential factor in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. The number of possibilities we encountered was both inspiring and surprising, though many are only partially realizable within our current capacity as a community.
This talk marks the beginning of a global series exploring how FOSS can address critical challenges such as traceability, trust, and collaboration, especially concerning the natural commons in both economic and social systems. We’ll discuss the role of FOSS tools in areas like global carbon emission measurement, climate investment, sustainable branding, accountability, carbon offsets, and local government sustainability efforts, offering innovative ideas and strategies to tackle these issues head-on.
In addition, we will demonstrate how FOSS, combined with open science methods, can combat greenwashing in the sustainability sector. By applying open and transparent principles, we will show how these approaches can help ensure that environmental claims are accurate and meaningful. This will be illustrated through a number of projects currently under development worldwide, as well as new ideas that we will present and discuss with the broader FOSS community, inviting collaboration and further development. Finally, we will show why openness is the most important indicator of environmental sustainability and explain this using practical examples.

### Plugin architecture for FOSS virtual classrooms: Unleashing innovation by teachers and learners with the BigBlueButton 3.0 plugin API and SDK

- **Speakers:** Fred Dixon, Steven Muegge, Tiago Daniel Jacobs
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 12:30 - 12:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6223-plugin-architecture-for-foss-virtual-classrooms-unleashing-innovation-by-teachers-and-learners-with-the-bigbluebutton-3-0-plugin-api-and-sdk/)

#### Abstract

BigBlueButton 3.0 introduced a plugin architecture for FOSS virtual classrooms.  Educators, hobbyists, and developers can employ the new plugin API and SDK to personalize the online classroom, interoperate with other FOSS projects, experiment with new learning technologies and approaches, implement their own ideas, and share their plugins with others -- without the overhead of modifying and recompiling the core platform source code.
This lightening talk briefly introduces FOSS developers to the new BigBlueButton 3.0 API and SDK, describes some of the FOSS innovations introduced so far as BigBlueButton plugins, and invites the community to build on this work for other FOSS applications.  The plugin architecture has lowered the learning and effort required to onboard new contributors, and has enabled casual experimentation and sharing by educators, hobbyists, and students who might not otherwise get involved in a FOSS project.  Anyone can try out your own ideas as virtual classroom plugins.  Meanwhile, it has also enabled education research on a range of topics including applications of generative AI, learning analytics, effective student engagement, and learning outcomes in online and hybrid teaching.

### How to Write a Killer README

- **Speakers:** Emily Omier
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 12:50 - 13:05
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4990-how-to-write-a-killer-readme/)

#### Abstract

An open source project’s README is like a website homepage. It’s the first part of your documentation someone is likely to read, and it's an opportunity for project maintainers to explain not just how someone should get started, but also the outcomes users can expect from using the project. If your README sucks, it will be the only doc that person reads before they go away and use a competing project with a better README. In this talk, Emily Omier will give the audience tips for improving the quality of their READMEs, so that they function both as an evangelism tool as well as a way for people new to the project to get started. She’ll provide concrete examples from projects with killer READMEs.

### A glimpse into a smoother version control experience

- **Speakers:** Pierre-Yves David
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 13:30 - 13:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5989-a-glimpse-into-a-smoother-version-control-experience/)

#### Abstract

Distributed version control has been around for 20 years and revolutionized the way developers collaborate with each other. One of these revolutions is the ability to edit your commits, to simplify code review and empower the project history. However some of these features are still viewed as arcane or dangerous by a share of the population, sometimes for good reasons.
For the past 15 years, the Mercurial VCS has been building on a set of features, called "changeset evolution" to make history rewriting more accessible and safer. Newer tools like Jujutsu or Sapling have shaped their user experience around parts of these features.
In this lighting talk, we won't dive into a full explanation, but simply unroll a simple scenario showing how simple commands you use everyday can be made more powerful, smoothing your day-to-day workflow, giving you a glimpse into what version control can be.

### subpatch: fearless multi-repository management - stay relaxed

- **Speakers:** Stefan Lengfeld
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 13:50 - 14:05
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6461-subpatch-fearless-multi-repository-management-stay-relaxed/)

#### Abstract

subpatch is a multi-repository management tool. Useful if you want to assemble a monorepo from multiple repositories, integrate third-party dependencies as source files, or maintain a local fork with a linear patch stack of an upstream project.
subpatch operates on several key principles. It utilizes “git add” to incorporate subproject files into the superproject, treating them as normal files. The metadata is stored in a Git-config-style configuration file. Subpatch supports modifications to subprojects, facilitating a linear patch stack, and simplifies the process of importing new versions and rebasing local modifications.
If you are currently using git-submodules or Google’s repo tool and you are frustrated, subpatch is maybe interesting for you!

#### Abstract

Wouldn't it be wonderful if all hosted software applications would store user data in a single place under a user's control. In the Solid project, we experiment with Personal Online Datastores that act as a pivot for data portability: service A stores your data in your pod, service B retrieves your data from your pod.
Now combine this vision with the Local-First vision, where data is first stored locally on your device, and then (collaboratively) synchronised with other computers across the network - resolving any edit conflicts through CRDT technology. Data flows from and to your device automatically. Any differences in data model are translated on the fly using technology like the Cambria project.
What this gives is an internet where data is 'liquid'; instead of each computer having its own bookkeeping, all relevant data stores are synchronised with each other, into one virtualised see of liquid data: The Ultimate Bookkeeping System ("TUBS").
This lighting talk will briefly summarise 3 years of open source research&development between Federated Bookkeeping and the Solid project.

### Open source should have an answer to Teams

- **Speakers:** Jos Poortvliet
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 14:30 - 14:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4514-open-source-should-have-an-answer-to-teams/)

#### Abstract

As we all know, Microsoft has a straightforward strategy that it shares with most other big tech firms from Silicon Valley: get all our data, then charge us for accessing it. MS 365 and Teams in particular are core to that strategy. This is why they gave it away 'for free' to so many organizations using COVID. To then turn around and send a bill after, because of course people USED it, uploading documents and such. So the lock-in was complete.
What makes Teams special? It's a complete solution. That is, video calls (think Zoom) + chat (think Slack or IRC) + document sharing (Dropbox) and document editing with MS Office, all in one.
There are a ton of open source alternatives, but none really answer this challenge, as most focus on one aspect - video calls, chat, document sharing... Some people 'frankensteined' solutions to integrate different tools, but user experience suffers and they are a nightmare to maintain. Open Source needs a singular, capable answer. And I argue that it exists - we announced it, December 3, 2024!

### Valence: Bringing the structural ambiguity of spoken language to code

- **Speakers:** Daniel Temkin
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 15:30 - 15:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6319-valence-bringing-the-structural-ambiguity-of-spoken-language-to-code/)

#### Abstract

Valence is a programming language written with eight Ancient Greek signs, each a homophone with many meanings. They are defined by context: each can be a command, an expression, or an octal digit. Its valence (number of parameters) and the order it appears determines its meaning, often with little relation to its other potential readings. If a line of code has no brackets to clarify the relation between signs, the program simply splits and both potential readings are carried out simultaneously. In this way, a single program can be a polyglot with many different executions running side by side. To write in Valence is to embrace this ambiguity. This lightening talk will not only show this design's unexpected repercussions, but also how we can mine spoken language to find new approaches to logic and code for creative expression.

### Taiwan's Shared OSS Community and Event Infrastructure: OPass App and  OSCVPass

- **Speakers:** Ian Liu
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 15:50 - 16:05
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6255-taiwan-s-shared-oss-community-and-event-infrastructure-opass-app-and-oscvpass/)

#### Abstract

Twenty years ago, a group of open-source enthusiasts in Taiwan came together to organize the first COSCUP (Conference for Open Source Coders, Users & Promoters). It began as a small gathering of 200 people, with the goal of uniting Taiwan's open-source community. Today, COSCUP has grown into a major event with over 3,000 participants. Along with its growth, tools and open-source projects were developed to be shared by Taiwan's open-source community—some of which are now being used internationally. This talk will introduce two key shared projects that have emerged from this journey.
- OPass (Open Pass & All Pass - Community Checkin with Interactivity Project) OPass  is a comprehensive event management tool, available as a web app, iOS, and Android application. Its features include self-service ticket scanning, agenda management, real-time notifications, and gamification modules. With simple JSON configuration files, OSS events can seamlessly integrate its API to access these services. Originally adopted by COSCUP, OPass is now widely used by other major events in Taiwan, including HITCON and PyCON TW. To enable its continued distribution on iOS and Android platforms, OCF acts as a non-profit custodian managing the app’s accounts for the community.
OSCVPass: Open Source Contributor VIP Pass. A project jointly developed by OCF and the community, connecting open-source contributors across Taiwan. Since its launch in 2019, the project has recorded over 600 contributions. Historically, many OSS events in Taiwan offered free tickets or additional benefits, such as photography services or snack bars, to individuals contributing to open-source projects. However, verifying these contributions required significant effort. OSCVPass simplifies the process by organizing a review committee made up of event organizers and community members. Approved contributors can use their OSCVPass to access these benefits across multiple events throughout the year.
The OPass App has extended its reach beyond Taiwan, with forks developed in India and interest from local government agencies for their events. OSCVPass, originally centered on OSS events, is now attracting collaborations with technical and commercial events, broadening its scope and impact.

### The Patient Brush: How to clean up a 16 year old Linux Kernel API

- **Speakers:** Philipp Stanner
- **Room:** H.2215 (Ferrer)
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 16:10 - 16:25
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4963-the-patient-brush-how-to-clean-up-a-16-year-old-linux-kernel-api/)

#### Abstract

Some of the Linux kernel's more fundamental APIs can be quite old, and some of them have been written in the "Wild West" era of the project. Naturally, such an API can accumulate hundreds, sometimes thousands of users. Some APIs haven't been cleanly designed from start to finish, but have grown steadily as the need arose, being written by several authors. Some ended up being used differently than expected.
Should it later be discovered that the API or its internals have minor or major issues, it cannot be changed anymore without simultaneously changing all the API users across dozens of subsystems, involving dozens of maintainers.
This implies that touching such an API is not only a technological topic, but also involves a good share of "kernel politics": you need to convince maintainers, partition your changes across several kernel releases, figure out a merge plan etc.
This talk is about such an API improvement process in the PCI subsystem, code for a bus that a lot of drivers rely on. We shall look into the following aspects:
- How do you know that the honorable old API, and not you, is the problem?
- Build a strategy to slowly phase the problem out, step-by-step over several kernel releases
- By being very careful, of course we'll ensure that nothing will explode!
- ... but things will explode anyways. What then?
- Maintainer relations 101: How to help the maintainer to easily merge your changes

- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5056-get-started-with-ada-in-2-minutes-or-less-/)

#### Abstract

There is a common sentiment that installing Ada's tooling is difficult, but that isn't the case.  Getting started with Ada has never been so easy!  In this lightning talk I explain how to go from having nothing Ada related on your computer to compiling your first program in less than 2 minutes using "GetAda" -- the unofficial installer for Ada's package manager, Alire.
GetAda is fully written in Ada and provides an easy one-liner that works on many unix-like systems: https://github.com/aj-ianozi/getada

### Advent of Compression: writing a working BZip2 encoder in Ada from scratch in a few days

- **Speakers:** Gautier de Montmollin
- **Room:** UB2.147
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 09:50 - 10:10
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5148-advent-of-compression-writing-a-working-bzip2-encoder-in-ada-from-scratch-in-a-few-days/)

#### Abstract

BZip2 is a famous and powerful lossless data compression format.
It is very good on some data, like English novels or computer source code.
An outstanding aspect of BZip2 is its simplicity.
No tricky hash trees or convoluted state machines.
However, compression software is generally very difficult to debug, in part impossible.
So it is better to do things right the first time and use a language that does its best finding errors before running your program.
I show you how I built a working encoder in a few days by leveraging the precise and customisable type system in Ada, especially range types that seem to have been made for this kind of software.

### Ada and Mini-Ada: a solution to the two-language problem

- **Speakers:** Gautier de Montmollin
- **Room:** UB2.147

- **Time:** 10:10 - 10:30
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4939-ada-and-mini-ada-a-solution-to-the-two-language-problem/)

#### Abstract

Ada and Mini-Ada: a solution to the two-language problem
The software world has quickly developped traditions.
One of them is to develop prototypes in an easy, readable scripting language X, then to translate them into another language Y which is fast but tricky - typically with a cryptic syntax and fragile memory handling.
Alternatively, you see projects with a part in language X and another part in language Y maintained by separate teams, plus people in the middle maintaining the interface between X and Y.
Also, some applications in Y embed language X for "live" plug-ins that can be changed during run-time by people who don't develop in Y.
Does it need to be that way?
Actually Ada makes those traditional but clumsy use cases obsolete, sometimes with the help of HAC (the HAC Ada Compiler).
We show you how, including with a live demo of HAC embedded within a "full Ada" application.

### Understanding liquid types, contracts and formal verification with Ada/SPARK

- **Speakers:** Fernando Oleo Blanco
- **Room:** UB2.147
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 10:30 - 11:00
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4879-understanding-liquid-types-contracts-and-formal-verification-with-ada-spark/)

#### Abstract

There are programming concepts that are not widely known. Most of the time this is due to languages not implementing such concepts or the way they are taught and presented make them seem a lot more technical and not-so-practical.
In this talk, I would like to explain what liquid types, contracts and proving code are. The examples will use the Ada programming language as it supports all of these features out of the box and it is a very easy to read and understand language. The examples given will also try to show the practicality of these features, as they are a set of wonderful techniques that tend to be overlooked in "real world" programs.

### The state of Rust trying to catch up with Ada

- **Speakers:** Oli Scherer
- **Room:** UB2.147
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 11:00 - 11:20
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5356-the-state-of-rust-trying-to-catch-up-with-ada/)

#### Abstract

Ada has held its own in the safety critical space for just over 4 decades. Over the last 10 years Rust has pushed into the same space with varying success. Among other features, most notably Rust is missing the powerful declarations and convenience of use of subtypes. In this talk I will go into the various features that make Ada so useful for ensuring the absence of bugs, and where Rust stands on each of these features.

### Cryptography in SPARK: building the foundation with constant-time bigints

- **Speakers:** César Sagaert, Fabien Chouteau
- **Room:** UB2.147
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 11:25 - 11:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5554-cryptography-in-spark-building-the-foundation-with-constant-time-bigints/)

#### Abstract

Constant-time big integer libraries are specialized tools designed to execute operations in a time that does not vary with the input values, thereby preventing side-channel attacks like timing attacks. They are foundational in cryptography, where maintaining consistent operation timing and memory access is crucial to ensuring secure key management and protecting sensitive data from exploitation.
In this talk, I will present my partially formally verified implementation of a “bigint” library in SPARK. I will show how it is implemented and how to use it. I will also share my experience writing this library as a newcomer to the Ada/SPARK ecosystem.

### Multiword Arithmetic and Parallel Computing

- **Speakers:** Jan Verschelde
- **Room:** UB2.147
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 11:45 - 12:05
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5155-multiword-arithmetic-and-parallel-computing/)

#### Abstract

In many applications, the precision by the available hardware arithmetic
is insufficient to guarantee accurate results.
Multiword arithmetic is a special type of multiprecision arithmetic
where a multiple double is an unevaluated sum of 64-bit doubles, or
where a multiple integer is an unevaluated sum of 64-bit integers.
Parallel computing is applied to compensate for the cost overhead
of multiword arithmetic.
This type of arithmetic exploits naturally the optimized hardware,
allows for efficient type conversions, memory layouts, all favorable 
for parallel computing.  For example, storing a multiword in registers 
rather than arrays is beneficial to parallel computing by tasking
and acceleration by graphics processing units.
Code for multiword arithmetic is available in the software PHCpack,
publicly available at github, and as an Alire crate,
released under the GNU GPL v3.0 license.

## Android Open Source Project (9)

### Finding an AOSP developer community

- **Speakers:** Chris Simmonds
- **Room:** H.2214
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 10:30 - 10:45
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6060-finding-an-aosp-developer-community/)

#### Abstract

Over many years I have observed that developers working with the Android platform do not talk to each other nearly enough. One reason is that there is no obvious place where AOSP developers can come together.  Following on from a discussion at a conference, a group of us set out to create a community led resource to fulfill that role. https://aosp-devs.org aims to:                                                                   

Reduce the fragmentation in the AOSP ecosystem by sharing code, tooling, and knowledge
Provide a repository for documentation, tutorials, and best practices
Provide a neutral place to host open source code outside of AOSP. A good example would be board support packages and other common patches                              
Provide communication channels where developers can ask questions and collaborate
Organise meetings on-line and in-person                                                            
Provide education 
Provide a conduit between Google, the AOSP community, and OEMs
A community is more than the sum of its parts

### AOSP bring-up using Software Rendering

- **Speakers:** Amit Pundir
- **Room:** H.2214
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 10:45 - 11:00
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6191-aosp-bring-up-using-software-rendering/)

#### Abstract

Display is a core requirement for AOSP. In the absence of a display/rendering interface, AOSP won't boot to completion. This short 10 min talk will talk about AOSP bring-up on pre-silicon/ emulated models or the devices which do not have a display/GPU support enabled yet. The author will talk about booting AOSP with software rendering libraries (SwiftShader + ANGLE) on a virtual display driver (VKMS).

### Forking Android considered harmful

- **Speakers:** Chris Simmonds, Stefan Lengfeld
- **Room:** H.2214
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 12:30 - 13:00
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6326-forking-android-considered-harmful/)

#### Abstract

If you want to use Android for your custom project, then you are almost inevitably going to have to modify the platform code. Typical reasons include supporting specialised hardware, running dedicated system services and pre-installing system apps. AOSP, and some parts of the Board Support Packages, are open source, so what's stopping you just changing the bits you need to? Indeed, this is the standard development model for Android platforms: fork; modify; repeat. Of course, we all know that forking is bad but there isn't any choice, especially when it is so difficult up merge changes upstream
Well, maybe there is a choice, In this talk we will examine the problems created by simply forking Android, and we will look at various ways to make the process more maintainable. In particular we will look at using local_manifests, and at maintaining out of tree patches for AOSP. In the latter case, we will talk about the tooling required to track patch sets ("layers") and the dependencies between them.
We hope that this will spark a conversation in the community through which we can establish best practice for maintaining custom Android systems without forking

### Towards a purely open AOSP: Adding Android-like functionality to AOSP

- **Speakers:** Bernhard "bero" Rosenkränzer
- **Room:** H.2214
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 13:00 - 13:30
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4106-towards-a-purely-open-aosp-adding-android-like-functionality-to-aosp/)

#### Abstract

AOSP is a great start - but increasingly doesn't deliver all the functionality you'd expect in a phone OS. Even the mail client that was present in early AOSP is no longer there: You're expected to use the closed-source GMail app.
This talk explains shows how to get most Android functionality on AOSP without having to use closed source applications.
It covers integrating GMS-like services through microG and Open Source alternatives to applications typically preinstalled on Android phones, as well as tricks for better integration of alternatives.

### Second chance: Upgrading devices from Android 9 to Android 14

- **Speakers:** Igor Kalkov-Streitz
- **Room:** H.2214
- **Day:** Saturday
- **Time:** 13:30 - 14:00
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5515-second-chance-upgrading-devices-from-android-9-to-android-14/)

#### Abstract

Progress in hardware development often leaves devices with outdated software versions behind. This primarily affects Android devices, especially as Google is currently accelerating its release schedule for Android versions. The rapid version change means that older devices are often left without software updates, which makes the devices vulnerable to security threats and compatibility problems. This presentation shows how this trend can be counteracted by upgrading a handheld device from Android 9 to Android 14 by using open-source components.
We will outline the entire upgrade process from migrating the kernel to UI and HAL customizations to match the original device’s look and feel. This includes discussing technical challenges developers face when dealing with outdated drivers, newer kernel versions, and hardware abstractions during OS upgrades of old devices.

### Building Agentic GraphQL APIs With LLM Tool Use & Knowledge Graphs

- **Speakers:** William Lyon
- **Room:** K.4.201
- **Day:** Sunday
- **Time:** 11:30 - 11:55
- **Event Page:** [Link](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5676-building-agentic-graphql-apis-with-llm-tool-use-knowledge-graphs/)

#### Abstract

This talk will introduce Modus, an open source framework for building intelligent GraphQL APIs powered by WebAssembly. We will learn how Modus auto-generates GraphQL APIs inferred by user-defined types and uses WebAssembly to enable highly performant and scalable APIs that run in a sandboxed memory efficient environment. Modus also brings the power of open source AI models to the API developer with first class support for working with AI models. We will demo using Modus to build an agentic API capable of fetching data from multiple sources and analyzing the data in real-time using knowledge graph RAG to make decisions using LLM tool use.
